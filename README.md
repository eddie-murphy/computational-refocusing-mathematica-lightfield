# computational-refocusing-mathematica-lightfield
Mathematica program that refocuses scenes that have been captured by light field cameras
## Main program located in **main.nb** 
### Main program contains detailed documenatation to explain code and theory. 
### Images used to compute the scene at different focal lengths are not included as that would generate a large folder size. Please go to the Stanford Light Field archive (<http://lightfield.stanford.edu>) to find the images.
## Notes:
* Main program with formating code visible is **main_formatting_code_visible.nb**
* pdf printouts which lack the gif animations are included.
* the .gif and .png files located in the root directory are used in the main.nb notebook but can also be viewed themselves
* Inside **Scene_at_different_focal_lengths** are folders for each each which contains: .. 
  * the notebook code that was used to take the images from the SLF Archive and compute the scene at different focal lengths (this code is also located in **main.nb** 
  * and a notebook which created the gif from the images of the scene at different focal lengths
